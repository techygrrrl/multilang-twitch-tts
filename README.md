# Multilang Text-to-Speech (TTS) app for Twitch on Windows

A multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) app for Windows.

This is just the installer and issue queue. To learn about this app before installing, check out the blog post: https://blog.techygrrrl.stream/multilingual-tts-twitch

If you'd like to route TTS audio to your headphones and not stream it to OBS, check out these [instructions in the wiki](https://github.com/techygrrrl/multilang-twitch-tts/wiki/Audio-routing-and-changing-output-devices-for-TTS).

## Known Issues

- [App won't start without voices installed](https://github.com/techygrrrl/multilang-twitch-tts/issues/5) - For now, until I can push up a fix, you will need to have both a French and a Spanish voice installed in order for the app to start. See the linked issue for more details.
